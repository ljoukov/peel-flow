I’ll give you panel-by-panel prompts you can feed into an image generation model. Each panel is described with setting, characters, and text balloons so you can get a consistent narrative.

🎨 Comic Strip Prompts: “Choosing My MacBook Air M4”

⸻

Panel 1: Introduction

Prompt:
Comic style, main character (young adult in San Francisco, excited but confused) standing in front of a glowing MacBook Air M4 13” display in a shop. Background: Golden Gate Bridge faintly in the window. Speech bubble: “Three stores, three deals… where should I buy my MacBook Air?” Caption: The Decision Begins.

⸻

Panel 2: Apple Store Option

Prompt:
Comic style, same character inside a sleek minimalist Apple Store. A friendly Apple employee gestures to the laptop. Speech bubbles:
	•	Employee: “Price: $999. Student discount? £100 off in UK or $100 off in US.”
	•	Main character (thinking): “But only 14 days return, and no price matching…”
Caption at bottom: Apple = simple, but rigid.

⸻

Panel 3: Amazon Option

Prompt:
Comic style, character in front of a giant Amazon box with Prime logo. Laptop floating on a cloud of discounts. Speech bubbles:
	•	Amazon mascot voice: “$200 off during sales! 30 days return window!”
	•	Main character (thinking): “Nice… but I’d need to return & rebuy if price drops again.”
Caption: Amazon = best raw discounts, but a hassle.

⸻

Panel 4: Best Buy Option

Prompt:
Comic style, character inside a colorful Best Buy store. Big yellow price-tag sign showing “Price Match!” Speech bubbles:
	•	Employee: “$999 today, but if Amazon drops, we’ll match and refund the difference!”
	•	Main character (smiling): “So I don’t need to return it? That’s less stress!”
Caption: Best Buy = flexible safety net.

⸻

Panel 5: Comparison Montage

Prompt:
Comic style, three mini panels side by side:
	•	Apple Store panel: rigid but shiny Apple logo, caption “14 days only.”
	•	Amazon panel: raining dollar bills, caption “$200 off, but return required.”
	•	Best Buy panel: shield + price tag, caption “Price match + longer returns.”

⸻

Panel 6: Closing

Prompt:
Comic style, main character walking happily out of the store with a MacBook Air box under arm, San Francisco skyline behind. Speech bubble: “Now I know my best option!” Caption: The End — or The Beginning of Many MacBook Adventures.

⚡ Tips for generation:
	•	Use a consistent character style across panels (e.g., “cartoon young adult in San Francisco with short hair, casual clothes”).
	•	Keep the color palette vibrant (blue for Apple, orange/black for Amazon, yellow for Best Buy).
	•	Ask the model to generate each panel separately, then stitch them into a strip.
